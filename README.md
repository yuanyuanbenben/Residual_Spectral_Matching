## Workflows

 Note: Change the path and set your own relative path in the line "***setwd("your path of the folder/simulation")***" of each R script if this line exists in simulation and "***setwd("your path of the folder/real_data_example")***", "***setwd("your path of the folder/real_data_example2")***" in the Netflix data example and the Amazon reviews data example . 

- ### Simulation for matrix denoising example.
	- run the shell file "***denoising.sh***" directly. 
- ### Simulation under different matrix size and different rank.
	- for the three case:*r = 5*, *r = 10* and *r = 20*, run the shell files "***simulation.sh***", "***simulation2.sh***", "***simulation3.sh***" for the results under different matrix size respectively of the rank constraint estimator and baseline.
 	- for the three case:*r = 5*, *r = 10* and *r = 20*, run the shell files "***convex_simulation.sh***", "***convex_simulation2.sh***", "***convex_simulation3.sh***" for the results under different matrix size respectively of the nuclear norm estimator and baseline.
	- for the three case:*r = 5*, *r = 10* and *r = 20*, run the shell files "***simulation_misrank.sh***", "***simulation_misrank2.sh***", "***simulation_misrank3.sh***" for the results under different selected rank respectively.
	- run the R script "***results_out.R***" to get the numerical results and performance plots.
 	- run the R script "***residual_plot.R***" to get the plots of residual matrix singular values' distributions.  
- ### Simulation under different noise level.

- ### Real data example: Netflix data
	- If using the original data, download the "***netflix_data.zip***" at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data) and unzip it as "***your path of the folder/real_data_example/netflix_data.csv***". Then run the R script "***realdata_preprocess.R***" to preprocess the original data. If not, omit this step. 
	- run the shell files "***case1.sh***", "***case2.sh***", "***case3.sh***", "***case4.sh***" for the results of the rank constraint estimator, baseline and their modifications in scenario 1 to 4.
